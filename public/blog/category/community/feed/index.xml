<p>The Graph Foundation recently announced the inclusion of NEAR into its expansive subgraph support, now encompassing over 40 leading L1 and L2 blockchains including Arbitrum, Base, Fantom, Celo, Optimism, Polygon Labs, and Scroll. By integrating with The Graph, NEAR developers gain access to a decentralized network for streamlined data querying, significantly reducing costs and improving synchronization speeds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The partnership highlights the NEAR Foundation&#8217;s ongoing commitment to enhancing developer resources and interoperability within open web ecosystems as part of advancing the Chain Abstraction vision. In 2021, NEAR became The Graph&#8217;s <a href="https://thegraph.com/blog/graph-near/">first non-EVM chain integration</a> for its hosted service, kickstarting the evolution towards a multichain open web ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subgraph support will take things a step further, facilitating better multichain data accessibility for NEAR builders and increasing the reach and breadth of tools and technologies to support Chain Abstraction. This moment also marks NEAR as the first non-EVM chain to become available on The Graph Network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-subgraph-support-empowers-near-developers">How Subgraph Support Empowers NEAR Developers</h2>



<p>Subgraphs on The Graph are transformative open APIs that efficiently organize and serve blockchain data, accelerating the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on the NEAR Protocol. This integration offers developers further support in efficient data querying, swift access to indexed blockchain data, and seamless interoperability across multiple chains.</p>



<p>By streamlining data retrieval, The Graph&#8217;s subgraph support eliminates the need for exhaustive blockchain scans, allowing for quick navigation, filtering, and location of specific data points. This advancement equips NEAR developers with tools similar to Web 2.0 search engine capabilities, tailored for the precision and complexity of blockchain data.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-graph-s-multichain-support-and-expansion-goals">The Graph&#8217;s Multichain Support and Expansion Goals&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Graph&#8217;s integration with NEAR and over 40 additional blockchains is a step towards more rich multichain development. By extending beyond Ethereum, The Graph is facilitating a unified, accessible ecosystem for designing advanced, user-focused decentralized applications (dApps) across a diverse range of blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enhancing interoperability among different blockchain networks also grants developers access to a broader spectrum of data, supporting the creation of dApps that are both feature-dense and user-friendly. These improvements also promote more unrestricted data exchange across chains for the purposes of dApp development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-protocol-and-future-of-the-graph-network">NEAR Protocol and Future of The Graph Network</h2>



<p>Looking forward, The Graph Network is aiming to break the barriers of decentralized access to blockchain data, as it plans to introduce new data services to meet the growing needs of Web3. The Graph’s core devs are planning ahead on executing the “<a href="https://thegraph.com/blog/unveiling-updated-sunrise-decentralized-data/">Sunrise of decentralized data</a>” initiative, designed to improve tooling and developer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon, NEAR devs building on The Graph Network will be able to take advantage of a free query plan, an intuitive subgraph upgrade wizard, and more.

<p>Frax Finance announced the launch of FRAX stablecoin on NEAR via Ref Finance and Burrow through FraxFerry and the Rainbow Bridge. This marks a significant milestone for Frax as its first major venture into a non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frax Finance is the second-largest issuer of decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoins and an industry leader for DeFi infrastructure.</p>



<p>The NEAR ecosystem and Frax contributors will now collaborate through ongoing in-depth research and protocol integrations. One of the biggest opportunities between the two teams will be the introduction of short-term treasury yields on NEAR using sFRAX, a yield-bearing asset that tracks the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Interest on Reserve Balance (IORB).</p>



<p>In the coming months, Frax will natively issue their suite of assets, FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH, and sfrxETH on NEAR and Fraxtal, along with exploring opportunities around NEAR LSTs. Other protocols on NEAR will also be able to explore these exciting frontiers with Frax. While NEAR supports various stablecoins, the decentralized Frax platform sets itself apart by offering additional features like yield and LSTs. These offerings can be utilized by NEAR&#8217;s DeFi protocols for novel ventures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This deployment is led by Ref and Burrow and will soon expand to other protocols. <a href="https://www.ref.finance/">Ref Finance</a> is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on NEAR Protocol, designed to facilitate the swapping, lending, and borrowing of digital assets. It is a multi-purpose DeFi platform that integrates various financial mechanisms, offering users a comprehensive suite of DeFi tools. <a href="https://burrow.finance/">Burrow</a> is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on the NEAR blockchain, offering non-custodial, pool-based lending and borrowing services.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Highlighting the Incentive Campaign</strong></p>



<p>To boost activity and foster growth of Frax on NEAR, Ref will introduce an incentive program offering rewards for Liquidity Providers (LPs) in the USDC/FRAX and NEAR/FRAX pools, as well as the Curve style stableswap pools.</p>



<p>The proliferation of native stablecoins is crucial to the growth of DeFi as it facilitates effortless access to liquidity between protocols for users across various types of exchanges. This allows for more seamless interactions with different projects across the Web3 ecosystem, effectively removing bottlenecks and promoting a smooth trading experience. This also advances the NEAR ecosystem vision of Chain Abstraction, streamlining usability and defragmenting liquidity and UX across all of Web3. Moreover, native stablecoins will significantly enhance the visibility of the NEAR Ecosystem&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) within the market.</p>



<p>On Burrow, borrowers and lenders will earn incentives for using USDC, USDT, and FRAX. Additionally, Burrow will offer rewards for NEAR and liquid staked NEAR, with more details to be announced soon.</p>



<p>This incentive campaign will be expanded&nbsp; to other qualifying DeFi protocols and primitives after the initial rollout on Ref and Burrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re new to NEAR, you can find free resources for building apps, deploying smart contracts,creating blockchain operating system(BOS) components, and more on the <a href="https://docs.near.org/#">DevRel resources page.&nbsp;</a>Checkout the official documentation of <a href="https://docs.frax.finance/">Frax</a> to learn more about protocol and other technical specifications.&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NEAR Foundation is proud to announce the inaugural launch of Near Public Goods Funding (NEARPGF) together with <a href="https://bos.potlock.org/">PotLock</a>, a new quadratic funding (QF) platform on NEAR. NEAR Foundation is allocating $100,000+ in initial funding to pilot funding campaigns conducted through PotLock. This initial contribution aims to empower promising and impactful projects building within the NEAR ecosystem.</p>



<p>Launched in late February, PotLock provides an opportunity for developers and innovators to showcase their projects and for the community to financially support the projects they believe in. By leveraging QF, resources will be allocated more democratically, ensuring projects with widespread community support receive the necessary financial backing to continue building.</p>



<p>The partnership between NEAR Foundation and PotLock will advance innovation across the NEAR ecosystem. From funding open-source developers and AI contributors, to startups in Africa building on NEAR, the goal of the partnership and of NEARPGF more broadly is to catalyze the building of public goods in the NEAR ecosystem.<br><br>Through this partnership, NEAR Foundation and PotLock aim to transform public goods funding into a collaborative, community-driven process. This vision reflects a joint commitment to cultivating an ecosystem where innovation, public utility, and equitable opportunities are at the forefront. By demanding greater accountability and measurable impact from funding recipients, while simultaneously providing a platform for fair compensation and recognition of contributions, the NEAR Foundation and PotLock are setting a new standard for public goods funding within the NEAR ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-qf-rounds-aka-pots">QF Rounds (AKA: “Pots”)</h2>



<p>PotLock’s QF rounds focus on specific areas for growth and innovation within the NEAR ecosystem. The verticals for this round include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Africa Round </strong>(March 5 &#8211; March 24th): Managed by NEAR Africa, this $3,000 round aims to empower communities and startups across Africa. It seeks to drive regional development, attract new donors, and strengthen existing projects with transformative potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Retroactive Builders Round </strong>(March 18th &#8211; April 7)<strong>: </strong>Managed by Build DAO, this $30,000 round rewards builders in the NEAR ecosystem who previously developed open-source projects without compensation.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Open Source Round </strong>(April 22 &#8211; May 5): Overseen by Banyan Collective, this $22,000 round targets a broad range of open-source projects, aiming to support initiatives that contribute to the public good of the NEAR ecosystem.<br><strong>AI Round </strong>(April 22 &#8211; May 5): Managed by Edge Intelligence, this $45,000 round aims to seed and support strategic open source AI builders and contributors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-qf">Understanding QF</h2>



<p>Quadratic Funding (QF) aims to revolutionize the way projects receive support by emphasizing the importance of community engagement and collective decision-making. Here&#8217;s how it accomplishes this: </p>



<p><strong>1. Broadening Participation through Small Contributions</strong>: QF encourages participation from all community members by giving significant value to numerous small donations rather than relying solely on a few large ones. This approach diversifies the funding base, allowing a wider array of projects to gain support.xr</p>



<p><strong>2. Enhanced Support with Matching Funds</strong>: Donations are not just contributions; they&#8217;re leveraged through a matching fund. The unique aspect of QF is the use of a quadratic formula to determine the amount of matching funds a project receives. This formula is designed to ensure that projects with a wider base of community support receive a larger portion of the matching funds, thus rewarding projects that appeal to a broader audience.</p>



<p><strong>3. Preventing Manipulation with Advanced Verification</strong>: To maintain the fairness and integrity of the funding process, PotLock utilizes NadaBot, an innovative identity aggregator built on NEAR protocol. NadaBot&#8217;s role is essential in verifying the uniqueness of each participant&#8217;s identity, effectively countering attempts at Sybil attacks where individuals could try to exert undue influence by creating multiple fake identities. </p>



<p>Through these mechanisms, QF seeks to make the process of supporting public goods and initiatives more democratic, ensuring that funding is distributed in a manner that truly represents the interests and priorities of the community.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-s-strategic-funding-objectives">NEAR’s Strategic Funding Objectives</h2>



<p>The NEAR Foundation&#8217;s collaboration with PotLock aims to revitalize the ecosystem and drive innovation through the following objectives:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Equitable Compensation</strong>: Ensure fair compensation for creators of public goods, focusing on undiscovered or under-resourced contributors to recognize their value within the NEAR ecosystem.</li>



<li><strong>Cultivating a Supportive Ecosystem</strong>: Foster a culture that recognizes and rewards contributions, reducing dependence on grants and promoting a self-sustaining community spirit.</li>



<li><strong>Innovative Funding Framework</strong>: Implement a proactive funding approach to stimulate ecosystem dynamism, by exploring novel funding strategies to engage projects across NEAR Social, NEAR Horizon, and DAO tooling.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced Visibility and Community Engagement</strong>: Increase awareness and participation in public goods and impact initiatives, driving community engagement and spotlighting meaningful projects within the ecosystem.</li>



<li><strong>External Support and Dynamic Sponsorships</strong>: Attract external partners to support these initiatives, enriching the ecosystem through diverse partnerships and sponsorships.</li>



<li><strong>Community Empowerment</strong>: Assist smaller NEAR communities in launching and managing their own funding cycles, ensuring widespread impact across the ecosystem.</li>



<li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: Collaborate with a broad range of stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of funding allocations and its overall impact on ecosystem growth.</li>
</ul>



<p>By achieving these objectives, the NEAR Foundation envisions a stronger, more innovative ecosystem where equitable compensation and broad participation drive further development in the Web3 space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-potlock-facilitates-funding-rounds">How PotLock Facilitates Funding Rounds</h2>



<p>PotLock operates in distinct phases, each essential to the QF cycle:<br><br><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QKDaXM-6PZRyOk6BZ44dARUQs8amT2pGrUIr-WoisNH6JD4-gHRLBPy7gGwuox9VgR5dl9mgEK77DR5FuOBtUGiJqG_ztlVLhYkA3ZT7cITRhO04O0xCNUZ0YKuEiAf0FuN2_GQmE1516qL7_DEl-2M" width="602" height="339"></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Activation</strong>: Once a “Pot” is initiated, participants can donate to a Pot, with their contributions matched by funds from the NEAR Foundation. Donors are recognized on a visual sponsor board.</li>



<li><strong>Application and Review</strong>: Projects submit applications to participate in the funding round. A designated authority, known as a Chef, reviews these submissions for eligibility and potential impact, selecting which will proceed to the matching phase.</li>



<li><strong>Donation and Matching:</strong> Approved projects receive direct contributions from verified donors, amplified by the QF model at the round&#8217;s close, ensuring widespread fund distribution and community engagement.</li>



<li><strong>Payout</strong>: After the matching phase, funds are distributed to projects, followed by a cooldown period before the next cycle begins.</li>
</ul>



<p>PotLock leverages an advanced asset-locking mechanism, allowing funders to securely store their digital assets in vaults protected by smart contracts. This feature is crucial for projects seeking funding, as it assures both security and accessibility of funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PotLock fosters transparency and verifiability by providing real-time insights into fund movements and allocations. This transparency builds trust by ensuring that funds are used ethically and effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NEAR&#8217;s presence at ETHDenver was nothing short of a triumph, demonstrating that collaboration is the key to success in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Forget about going it alone &#8211; NEAR brought the entire ecosystem to the party, and the results were epic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-s-a-taste-of-the-near-flavored-goodness-that-went-down">Here&#8217;s A Taste Of The Near-Flavored Goodness That Went Down</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-eu.googleusercontent.com/nwiUAYBQhJMWYE14tyx-q6OvXfuwZawUuK09DFXd0J6fF4N9Ov2PUzMAc_qZxSQ2fqdizxS0VtdukuN-XfoVwxaDcaP3uXT2nj_J9wTXpmDdo7J5PvHyBdHYEiHra2xYrHM7jfGFJ3CvSx7N65WfJ40" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The week kicked off with Altan Tutar&#8217;s insightful presentation, &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrWs1ty2fXo">The Future of DeFi: NEAR Protocol&#8217;s Role and Potential</a>,&#8221; where he shared NEAR’s DeFi vision, addressing fragmentation and modularity. NEAR aims to become the single platform seamlessly connecting users to DeFi applications across different blockchains.</p>



<p>Illia Polosukhin, NEAR&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, followed suit at the Decentralized AGI Summit. His panel, &#8220;The Evolution to AGI,&#8221; explored the development of sovereign digital AGI and its ethical implications. He emphasized the need to balance centralization and decentralization to foster community ownership and innovation. Keeping AI in check is crucial, after all.</p>



<p>But that wasn’t his only appearance. Illia managed to be ubiquitous across ETHDenver, including an exciting main stage talk with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32DKp9CX4NQ">Erik Voorhees on decentralizing AI</a>. He also delivered a captivating presentation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5jJkvCG338">Digital Self-Sovereignty in the Age of AI</a> just before presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the stage for ETHDenver’s closing session.</p>



<p>The education continued with Kendall Cole from Proximity Labs, who provided insights into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCkOTjbJD3c">Threshold Signatures and how they unlock the magic of bridgeless cross-chain interoperability</a>. By enabling &#8220;bridgeless&#8221; cross-chain applications, this technology empowers developers to create applications that seamlessly work across different blockchains, even those without smart contracts like Bitcoin or Dogecoin, using programmable multi-party computation (MPC). Users can interact with these applications effortlessly while security remains ensured through MPC signing nodes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzjDN0MG09c">Bowen Wang from Pagoda dove into Stateless validation</a>, addressing both scalability and decentralization. This approach tackles the ever-growing state size by allowing validators to operate without storing the entire history, significantly reducing storage pressure and potentially enabling more powerful hardware and lower costs, fostering a more decentralized network over time. Furthermore, stateless validation using zero-knowledge proofs holds promise for even greater scalability and affordability &#8211; more power to the validators!</p>



<p>Finally, NEAR Foundation’s COO, Chris Donovan, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPGGJYqSkSM">championed chain abstraction as the key to breaking down the barriers currently fragmenting the Web3 future</a>. The fragmented landscape of blockchains presents a hurdle to widespread adoption and collaboration within Web3. By simplifying the user experience and fostering collaboration across the industry, chain abstraction paves the way for a frictionless and prosperous Web3 future. Think of it as a universal translator for blockchains.</p>



<p>Phew, That was a lot! But NEAR&#8217;s impact went far beyond informative talks. The NEAR booth was ground zero for epicness, attracting big names.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was an incredible first-ever <a href="https://nearapac.org/">NEAR APAC</a>, with the NEAR ecosystem scootering through Saigon over the last two days. Vietnam served as the perfect backdrop for NEAR’s inaugural showcase in Asia-Pacific, with community members, B.O.S. builders, and general Web3 enthusiasts coming together in one of the region&#8217;s most dynamic countries.</p>



<p>The event was spearheaded by the <a href="https://nearvietnamhub.org/">NEAR Vietnam Hub</a> with support from the NEAR Foundation, exemplifying strong commitment and collaboration between local and global ecosystem stakeholders.&nbsp; ICYMI, here are some of the biggest sessions, announcements, and events from NEAR APAC 2023.</p>



<p>ICYMI, here are some of the biggest sessions, announcements, and events from NEAR APAC 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-web3-s-bright-investment-outlook-in-asia-pacific">Web3’s bright investment outlook in Asia-Pacific</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20876" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-768x511.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the most encouraging and optimistic sessions was moderated by NEAR’s Head of Finance, David Norris, focusing on the current and future outlook of blockchain investment and development in the region. David was joined by Web3 venture veterans Riccardo Pagano from <a href="https://outlierventures.io/">Outlier Ventures</a> and Whiplus Wang of <a href="https://www.ivcrypto.io/">IVC crypto</a>.</p>



<p>The trio dove into the current state of blockchain investment in APAC, and how Web3 might just ascend to becoming one of the most invested sectors in the region from a venture and infrastructure perspective. Ricardo in particular emphasized that he’s seeing a shift in perception from investors, with Web3 going from a niche technology to its own broad-based sector.</p>



<p>“Even though we’re technically in a bear market, investment in Web3 sub-sectors like gaming is still strong,” added Whiplus. “Games like<em> Angry Birds </em>and <em>Fruit Ninja</em> were instrumental in onboarding Web2 users onto the smartphone, for example. That’s why investment into blockchain game publishers is increasing — to find that killer game that onboards billions.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20874" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-768x511.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Whiplus also likened successful blockchain startups to a bowl of Pho, with a blend of technical and business elements being integral to a delicious final dish. The panel also touched on technical nuances like ZK rollups and modular blockchains, emphasizing the need to invest in talent and innovation through initiatives like hackathons.</p>



<p>The session encapsulated a forward-looking perspective on Web3&#8217;s trajectory. With the bar for founder participation evidently rising, the panel stressed the importance of education in the space. There was unanimous optimism about Southeast Asia&#8217;s digital future as potentially outpacing even established tech hubs like Korea and Japan.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-supports-b-o-s-and-blockchain-builders-in-apac">NEAR supports B.O.S. and blockchain builders in APAC</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20871" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-768x512.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Tons of activity also took place in and around the Builder Stage, with the NEAR Foundation and local blockchain organizations teaming up to educate and assist developers, builders, and job seekers in advancing themselves into Web3. Cameron Dennis, CEO of <a href="https://www.banyan.gg/">Banyan</a>, led a panel on the stage informing developers on how to upskill from Web2 to Web3.</p>



<p>Local developer advocates from notable projects like the Graph and Khyber network also participated in sessions, workshops, and panels on the Builder Stage designed to upskill local blockchain professionals. There was something for everyone, from a job fair for Web3 newbies to a Greenhouse area connecting founders and projects to VCs for funding.</p>



<p>Exploring everything from dApp architecture to tokenomics, the Builder Stage action was highlighted by an incredible Hackathon, with participants receiving guidance from experts like Oleg Fomenko, founder of <a href="https://sweateconomy.com/">SWEAT</a>. On the final night of the festivities, NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin presented awards to the winners on stage in front of a packed main hall.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pagoda-takes-the-main-stage-to-talk-user-adoption-and-fastauth">Pagoda takes the main stage to talk user adoption and FastAuth</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20873" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-768x512.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Alex Chiocchi, the CPO of <a href="https://www.pagoda.co/">Pagoda</a>, showcased FastAuth during his session titled &#8220;Unlocking the Power of B.O.S: Product Update for Founders &amp; Developers.&#8221; FastAuth aims to redefine the user experience for developers and founders, addressing the longstanding challenges of both onboarding and retaining new Web3 users.</p>



<p>A primary takeaway was how FastAuth’s next release will minimize gas fees when onboarding, thus removing barriers for end-users. The introduction of multiparty compute (MPC) allows proofs from various organizations to be combined, simplifying processes like email recovery. Chiocchi emphasized the potential for users to migrate effortlessly from Web2 logins, hinting at a seamless integration between the two web generations.</p>



<p>Discussing the nuances of retaining users in Web3, Chiocchi stressed that coin incentives alone aren&#8217;t sufficient. The &#8220;toothbrush test&#8221; was highlighted, illustrating that many apps don&#8217;t become daily necessities for users. Trust plays a pivotal role, especially with the rise of scams in the decentralized space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-side-events-and-after-parties-storm-the-streets-of-saigon">Side events and after-parties storm the streets of Saigon</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20872" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-768x511.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>NEAR APAC fully embraced the “work hard, play hard” ethos of Vietnam and Asia-Pacific. Even during the event, there were LED dancers, Manga Cosplay, and several massive DJs and party breaks. Not to mention the NEAR APAC Opening Night party at the Intercontinental Hotel, where Illia officially welcomed attendees and kicked things off in an intimate setting.</p>



<p>And in one of the coolest side events in recent NEAR memory, Dap Dap showcased its platform to B.O.S. enthusiasts at the My House meeting venue nestled in one of Saigon’s many cozily-lit alleyways. Dap Dap is the first commercial B.O.S. product and will act as a gateway to hundreds of chains and protocols for users from a single, user-friendly interface.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20875" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-768x511.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>B.O.S Beats by <a href="https://www.daorecords.org/">DAO Records</a> was the grand finale of NEAR APAC, offering a vibrant blend of hip-hop beats from prominent DJs on the decentralized record label. Held at Indika Saigon — and with pizza supplied by Pizza DAO — attendees enjoyed live performances, refreshments, and networking opportunities with the global and APAC NEAR communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR APAC was an incredible Web3 Bánh Mì, layering an eclectic mix of speakers, insights, and events to create something completely unique. The NEAR Foundation would like to thank every cook in the kitchen, especially local partners like the NEAR Vietnam Hub who made sure that the first ever NEAR APAC had the perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Validators are the backbone of the NEAR Protocol, playing an integral role in upholding the network&#8217;s core values now and into the future. Validators ensure that NEAR Protocol remains scalable, user-friendly, secure, trustworthy, and most importantly, decentralized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR validators provided community feedback on how to improve the validator experience, and we collectively listened. Responses suggested that routes to secure funding were unclear, and that existing delegations from the NEAR Foundation lacked transparency.<br>The result of the community feedback process is a new <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yjQ75peBJlUkxHvx9u4o0Dbsy-t5ofbEaXvKzY3shco/edit">NEAR Protocol Validator Delegation Proposal</a> and an open call RFP to coordinate the NEAR Protocol Institutional Validator Programme. The RFP will be open until Monday September 24th, 2023.</p>



<p>Drafted in collaboration with a number of ecosystem participants — Meta Pool, Banyan Collective, DevHub, Pagoda, Proximity, Validator Community, and NEAR Foundation — this proposal creates a framework for a refreshed validator delegation structure. It clearly defines a number of expectations for validators, aims to align incentives, assigns ownership, and enhances transparency around securing funding support.</p>



<p>The proposal’s framework addresses <strong>three</strong> <strong>delegation tracks</strong> — <strong>community validators, institutional validators, and 100% fee project validators</strong> — with the goals of improving transparency, strengthening the Nakamoto coefficient of the NEAR Protocol, and increasing validator selection at custody providers: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Community Validators</strong> — Individual participants or smaller entities within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem who choose to operate validator nodes. They are strong advocates of NEAR Protocol’s principles and values, and actively contribute to the decentralization and security of the blockchain. The proposal addresses issues that Community Validators face, including resource constraints, rewards, vulnerability to attacks, and limited influence, building on new proposals for Community validators put forward in <a href="https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.community.activity?handle=validators">June</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Institutional Validators</strong> — Typically large entities, such as companies, financial institutions, or well-established organizations. They often have significant resources and stake in the NEAR Protocol, which allows them to operate powerful and reliable infrastructure to maintain the blockchain. This proposal addresses concerns around institutional validators such as network centralization, lack of community inclusivity, and inequality in influence.</li>



<li><strong>100% Fee Project Validators</strong>&nbsp; — A track to support growth activities resulting in onboarding of users to the NEAR Protocol, and continued engagement through retention programmes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Firstly, check out the full <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yjQ75peBJlUkxHvx9u4o0Dbsy-t5ofbEaXvKzY3shco/edit">NEAR Protocol Validator Delegation Proposal</a> and provide any feedback publicly <a href="https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.community.activity?handle=validators">here</a>. Your feedback is greatly appreciated to improve the proposal.</p>



<p>Secondly, since this is an open call RFP to run the NEAR Protocol Institutional Validator programme, please return any applications to finance@near.foundation.</p>



<p>Additionally, Restaking is coming to NEAR courtesy of Octopus Network. Under Octopus 2.0, $NEAR stakers will have the ability to secure appchains with their staked $NEAR. Find out more <a href="https://oct.network/">here</a></p>



<p>Many thanks for your continued support to improve the validator experience and help secure the NEAR Protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://cosmose.ai/web3">Cosmose AI</a>, the global platform that uses AI to predict and influence how people shop offline is launching a new piece of technology designed to disrupt the smartphone lock screen experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Called KAIKAINOW, it brings together artificial intelligence and blockchain to help users stay informed and engaged with the world around them without the hassle of unlocking their phones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KAIKAINOW, an opt-in technology, sits on a user&#8217;s home screen. It offers a variety of curated content, including news, language learning, games, and trending stories which would be interspersed between users’ very own personal wallpaper pictures.</p>



<p>“We check our smartphone lock screens on average 80 times a day, always seeing the same&nbsp; wallpaper backdrop. Imagine, instead of seeing the same image over and over again you see it every other time, while enjoying personalized content during remaining interactions,” says Miron Mironiuk, Founder and CEO of Cosmose AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KAIKAINOW changes that by harnessing cutting edge AI technology, and pairing it with open web tools found on the NEAR blockchain to ensure the experience is tailored to the user while always adhering to the highest privacy standards.</p>



<p>“The launch of KAIKAINOW by COSMOSE AI shows how far we’ve come in respects to transforming Web3 from an innovative idea to a something that can deliver real world benefits to consumers, while also helping foster brand loyalty and business growth in the retail space,” says Marieke Flament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to align ourselves with such a fantastic, rapidly growing tech firm such as Cosmose AI and look forward to seeing how it will truly transform the world of retail and get the world closer to Web3 mass adoption.”</p>



<p> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blockchain-meets-ai">Blockchain meets AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Publishers and brands provide the content and KAIKAINOW enhances the experience by allowing users to unlock rewards via KAI-CHING, a native token pegged to the US Dollar built on the NEAR Protocol. These tokens can then be used to access exclusive offers only available to KAIKAINOW users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to KAI-CHING, shoppers and retailers benefit from shorter payment processing time and significantly lower fees.</p>



<p>By building both consumer products and its token on NEAR protocol, Cosmose AI is accelerating its Web3 offerings with one of the world’s leading, open source blockchain platforms and further advancing the AI-driven retail ecosystem.</p>



<p>To date, Cosmose AI has served over 20 million stores and reached one billion phones globally. The integration of NEAR technologies means that Cosmose can ensure that users maintain complete control over their data and benefit from the ecosystem they help create. This approach ensures the highest level of privacy for users and aligns with the Company&#8217;s commitment to user safety.</p>



<p>Blockchain’s digital record, paired with NEAR’s open web tooling, means AI services can help improve trust in data integrity and, by extension, in the recommendations that AI provides. Using blockchain to store and distribute AI models provides an audit trail, and pairing blockchain and AI can enhance data security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR is helping partners like Cosmose AI harness these tools to create better products that serve customers and partners equally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would&#8217;ve been hard to imagine topping a jam-packed Day 1 of NEAR APAC, but Day 2 managed to do just that. The gorgeous Sunday in Saigon covered a wide range of topics, including significant discussions on the future trends in Web3 such as how brands can hop on board the Web3 bandwagon and a creative proposal to unite all Layer 1&#8217;s for mass adoption.</p>



<p>With each session, industry leaders shed light on challenges and the future trajectory of the fast-paced Web3 ecosystem in APAC. From the unique positioning of Web3 gaming in Asia to the potential rise of the next Web3 cycle, the discussions were varied and far-reaching. Let&#8217;s dive on into all the Day 2 happenings at NEAR APAC in Vietnam!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apac-experts-discuss-the-next-big-trends-in-web3">APAC experts discuss the next big trends in Web3</h2>



<p>Let’s begin the Day Two recap with a standout panel diving into the next big Web3 trends. Experts agreed that it won’t just be about technological progress, but also the transformative ways that blockchain will weave into daily life. Asset tokenization, generative AI integration, and the proliferation of decentralized creator economies were some top trends on the table.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RgVgqs1g0x-gnx5Kvaa6mVPfaIXaZxyV1m_WAE0Ce6zUb-OKD6-LI066PiE1II_S3T9bDYSHDGyGVyG5Np03ekD10YSpe6r5bbN36500oObHLrOGuQD3Q2W_po-e_vF-tBOVuvLoBIHvgM0lZiJPI5I" alt=""/></figure>



<p>“Generative AI and asset tokenization are revolutionizing Web3 ecosystems, especially in growing economies like India,” said Sudeep Choudhari, head of blockchain at the <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/">India National Payments Corporation</a>. “As integration across borders accelerates, we’ll also challenge traditional FX rates, anticipating a future with minimal cross-border payment costs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hanna Tantoco, APAC Marketing Director at <a href="https://www.blockdaemon.com/">Blockdaemon</a>, piggybacked on the transformative role of generative AI in enhancing blockchain user experiences. She also pointed out the rising prominence of gaming in Asia, particularly on NEAR. Additionally, she highlighted Singapore&#8217;s burgeoning creator economy, powered largely by NFTs, as another future trend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-brands-can-futureproof-themselves-with-blockchain">How brands can futureproof themselves with blockchain</h2>



<p>Another morning highlight was a panel discussion about how brands and enterprises can harness the potential of Web3 to adapt and thrive. Key points revolved around democratizing user data control, countering data monopolization by tech giants, tokenizing assets, and challenges in linking the physical and digital worlds.</p>



<p>“Enterprises often face challenges with hiring experts who may quickly move on to other projects,” observed Oleg Fomenko, founder of <a href="https://sweatco.in/">SWEAT</a>. “While consultancies can provide insights, the real breakthrough comes when you start building and experimenting with MVPs. Though initial attempts might fall short, perseverance can yield surprising results.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Sd5LLo5KtoZlpO890p-2gemKPglzS_SZ4oWvR0pbA9WS1QOKwX-KJJCRBvObEAfU2shd5zUxumyCybxoyQT6OLdB_TbzLsOY6X-xrcfjVbRwp3UzXdhEFaVVk1sCFuO3x0PIQJ2xxlqQdk9SjCmrKVw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Alex Chiocchi, CPO of <a href="https://www.pagoda.co/">Pagoda</a>, added that Web3 streamlines verification, challenging traditional ad networks. By using an open blockchain system, excessive fees are prevented, promoting shared value with users. This shift allows benefits like self-custody and reputation while redistributing margins back to the people.</p>



<p>Among the key takeaways from the session was that businesses harnessing blockchain&#8217;s capabilities can anticipate a transformative impact on the global economy, especially with asset tokenization&#8217;s projected growth through 2030. As brands navigate challenges like ensuring digital authenticity and early adoption, having a targeted strategy is crucial.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-web3-gaming-asia-s-landscape-and-blockchain-utilization">Web3 gaming: Asia&#8217;s landscape and blockchain utilization</h2>



<p>The Asian gaming landscape is buzzing with the rise of Web3 development, promising an unprecedented era of innovation and user empowerment. Central to discussions at the &#8220;Web3 Gaming: Asia Landscape&#8221; session was the gaming community&#8217;s appetite for asset and data ownership, often prioritizing this over the complexities of Web3 itself.</p>



<p>After attending Korea Blockchain Week, it&#8217;s evident that Japan and Korea&#8217;s mobile giants are pioneering in Web3 gaming,” said Luke Xie, founder of gaming VC fund <a href="https://pressstart.capital/">Press Start Capital</a>. “As opposed to Web3 games like Axie, creating AAA games takes much longer. Given the rapid pace of crypto, former mobile developers align better with this fast-paced dynamic.”</p>



<p>Ishank Gupta, co-founder of <a href="https://www.kratosstudios.io/">Kratos Studios</a> in India, emphasized that gamers prioritize asset and data ownership over backend Web3 tech. He predicted that blockchain games should bring benefits that gamers care about with a focus on ease of usability. For instance, leading studios in India are integrating well-known IP into Web3 games while ensuring they remain engaging.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re witnessing a new golden age of gaming driven by indie studios,” added Xie. “Small teams, empowered by AI, are crafting games that punch above their weight. We believe that on-chain gaming, while difficult to execute at present, is the future. It’s all about selecting the right chain based on tech, community, and support. NEAR excels at all of the above.”</p>



<p>The panel agreed that the Web3 gaming industry in APAC and beyond is undergoing a transformative phase, with blockchain offering gamers more control over assets and data. As developers continue to build, the focus will be on seamless onboarding, speed, and user-centric experiences. Blockchains should be subtly integrated without disrupting the gaming experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bringing-web3-together-with-multichain-a-call-for-collaboration">Bringing Web3 together with Multichain: a call for collaboration&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Today’s blockchain landscape consists of independent Layer 1’s vying for supremacy, bringing up the core question of interoperability. With users often navigating several ecosystems, creating cross-chain experiences becomes paramount. This star-studded panel explored new frameworks to address hurdles and challenges in the current siloed multi-chain user experience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-20842" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content//uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>“Web3&#8217;s ethos is modularity, similar to Lego blocks,” explained NEAR CEO Marike Flament. “While we prioritize access and user growth, interoperability challenges persist. But trust and unified solutions drive adoption, not a fractured approach. It&#8217;s essential that technology seamlessly serves the end user.”</p>



<p>Cameron Dennis, CEO of <a href="https://www.banyan.gg/">Banyan</a>, added that key management is a critical issue. He pointed out ways to simplify these processes with tools like <a href="https://wiki.near.org/overview/BOS/fast-auth">FastAuth</a>. Dennis added that addressing the noticeable gap in cross-chain liquidity should be a focus. He believes that a true multichain future that drives adoption will solve key and wallet management for a better UX.</p>



<p>“Reflecting on a decade in this space, the competitive landscape has shifted,” mused Mary Beth Buchanan from the Cardano Foundation who is also an advisor to NEAR, “Earlier, exchanges hesitated to collaborate, fearing a loss of advantage. Today, there&#8217;s a collective push to learn from one another, ensuring technology works seamlessly for the end user.”</p>



<p>Cameron believes that reinforcing the current ecosystem is paramount before extending cross-chain efforts, even though creating a decentralized internet remains a resource-intensive endeavor.</p>



<p>Marieke stressed the importance of open-source technology in attracting top talent. Drawing inspiration from Web2&#8217;s approach to 5G standardization, she suggested that Layer 1 leaders could unite in an &#8216;L20&#8217; alliance to champion unified standards, fostering a unified vision for the industry&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>And that’s a wrap for the official Day 2 sessions at NEAR APAC. From gaming and brand adoption to multi-chain standards and collaboration, it was clear that this first-of-its-kind regional event was a rousing success for developers and the NEAR community alike. Sunday in Saigon rolls on with more side events and after-parties, so stay tuned for the full ICYMI tomorrow.</p>

<p>After many months in the making, the inaugural NEAR APAC conference kicked off today in Ho Chi Min City, Vietnam. Held in conjunction with the <a href="https://nearvietnamhub.org/">NEAR Vietnam community</a> and NEAR Foundation, NEAR APAC is showcasing the vibrant crypto and Web3 community across the region as well as the potential of the B.O.S. and Open Web both locally and globally.</p>



<p>The day was charged with excitement, drawing over 8,000 attendees from various corners of the APAC region and beyond. With Web3 thought leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts converging in Vietnam, Day One of NEAR APAC kicked off with a slew of riveting discussions, industry insights, and speculations on the future of the Open Web with a focus on APAC.</p>



<p>From discussions around regional growth and investment potential to how AI and blockchain will transform the future of work, here’s everything that went down at an incredible start to NEAR APAC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-setting-the-stage-for-near-apac-with-vietnam-in-focus">Setting the stage for NEAR APAC with Vietnam in focus</h2>



<p>The event kicked off with a focus on southeast Asia, with NEAR’s Vietnam country director Riley Tran welcoming attendees and providing context as to Asia’s critical role in the overarching development and expansion of Web3. Tran was followed by two NEAR luminaries, CEO Marieke Flament and co-founder Illia Polosukhin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Asia&#8217;s young demographics and rapid digital growth, especially in Vietnam, position it as a leader in crypto and blockchain growth,” Riley explained. “With over 100 million new internet users in just three years, Asia&#8217;s momentum in Web3 is accelerating”</p>



<p>Marieke added that the overall NEAR ecosystem remains strong with over 29M active wallets and 650K daily active accounts. She added that a collaborative approach to building tomorrow’s Open Web is critical for tackling significant societal and digital challenges.<br><br>&#8220;Today’s Web 2.0 is closed and siloed, with the prevailing digital culture being a toxic dialectic,&#8221; Marieke expressed. “But the value loop of an Open Web holds immense promise. We’re already seeing how projects like KaiKai, SWEAT, and PlayEmber can move the needle in the right direction.&#8221;</p>



<p>Echoing Mariek’s sentiment, Illia emphasized that it’s not necessarily about championing a specific blockchain, but about creating a common layer and interface for the Open Web. This is precisely what the Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S.) is in the process of achieving.</p>



<p>&#8220;Looking forward, tech isn&#8217;t the only focus,” said Illia. “It&#8217;s about blending scalable solutions with user-centric experiences, with the B.O.S. becoming the essential entry point into Web3 for both users and developers.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-asia-s-role-in-mainstream-adoption-and-regulatory-hurdles">Asia’s role in mainstream adoption and regulatory hurdles</h2>



<p>The push for mainstream blockchain adoption in APAC was also in focus on Day One, with NEAR Foundation CMO Jack Collier leading a panel discussion on current adoption challenges and how APAC can potentially lead the way in overcoming them.</p>



<p>“I’m extremely bullish on gaming as a key part of mass adoption,” opined Don Pham, Google Cloud’s regional Web3 specialist. “Vietnam is the birthplace of Axie Infinity, which is just the beginning of blockchain gaming’s potential. Use cases like loyalty, gaming, and music NFTs combined with better UX will likely be the path forward.”</p>



<p>The discussion dove deeper into the importance of user experience in the adoption of blockchain. Marieke reiterated that while technology forms the backbone, the real test will be simplifying the user journey, which can significantly hasten adoption across the APAC region as well as globally.</p>



<p>Regulation was also in focus with a panel about blockchain policies and APAC&#8217;s vision for governments and associations. Mary Beth Buchanan, a board member of the Cardano Foundation, drove home the need for regulatory clarity while discussing regional frameworks in countries like Hong Kong.</p>



<p>“The biggest challenge is not necessarily regulation, but lack of clarity,” observed Buchanan. “If regulations are unclear that will cause investors not to want to invest in the space. Builders become hesitant to build and users aren’t going to know what the rules are. Regulators need to recognize that clarity is what everyone wants.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotlight-on-artificial-intelligence-during-the-afternoon-sessions">Spotlight on Artificial Intelligence during the afternoon sessions</h2>



<p>Day One of NEAR APAC dedicated a significant chunk of its schedule to exploring the intricate interplay between AI and blockchain, particularly their role in APAC’s future technology and Web3 landscape. Illia took the stage just after the lunch break to discuss the Convergence of AI and Web3, diving deep into AI-empowered DAO and the future of AI-assisted work.</p>



<p>“While technologies like ChatGPT have found product market fit, much of AI is still siloed and doesn’t empower open source communities and projects,” Illia posited. “Web3 can operate in the middle, with AI models incorporating all participants and data sources. DAOs, for example, can be co-piloted by AI to achieve goals and KPIs faster and more efficiently.”</p>



<p>In the following panel discussion entitled “The Roles of Blockchains in an AI World,” Illia was joined by several AI and blockchain experts from the APAC region. One of the more distinguished panel members was Dr. Nguyen An Khuong, a lecturer and blockchain researcher from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, who provided an academic perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have a lot of research endeavors in Vietnam around ensuring AI&#8217;s ethical applications using blockchain,” commented Dr. Nguyen. “We’re looking at how transparency and accountability in AI decisions can be drastically improved with blockchain technology. Combining a neutral AI with a blockchain’s public ledger could enhance the ecosystem and foster wider adoption.”</p>



<p>Illia drove home that the potential “Skynet” scenario of AI taking over the world is mostly a projection of what humans might do if they were given supercomputing powers. In reality, developments like the B.O.S. and NEAR Tasks will aid humans in success and productivity, with AI agents acting as middlemen for assistance, sourcing, and even creativity.</p>



<p>Day One of the first-ever NEAR APAC was a rousing success, with these highlights just being the tip of the iceberg. The crowd was treated to bánh mì’s and Manga cosplay during lunch, B.O.S. building and gaming workshops on the Builder Stage, and an awe-inspiring NFT gallery from APAC creators.</p>



<p>As the sun sets in Saigon, the NEAR Foundation couldn’t be more appreciative of the Vietnamese crypto community. The momentum rolls on tomorrow with Day Two, so stay tuned for more updates and insights around emerging APAC trends in Web3, how blockchain gaming is taking off in Asia-Pacific, and local DeFi developments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Day One was any indication, the NEAR community’s growth, presence, and development in APAC will only continue accelerating through 2023 and beyond!</p>
