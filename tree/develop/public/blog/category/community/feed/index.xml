<p>The NEAR Foundation announced a slew of partnerships and developments at this year’s International Tech Summit in Bermuda, organized by Penrose Partners.</p>



<p>The new collaborations will leverage Bermuda’s unique crypto-friendly regulatory environment to accelerate the integration of digital assets into global markets. They’ll also enhance NEAR’s role in advancing blockchain applications across sectors. From NFTs to insurance, here’s the full rundown.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-foundation-and-penrose-a-strategic-alliance-at-the-tech-summit">NEAR Foundation and Penrose: A strategic alliance at the Tech Summit</h2>



<p>As the presenting partner of the International Tech Summit, the NEAR Foundation cemented a significant relationship with Penrose Partners, a leading international digital asset advisory firm. It’s part of NEAR&#8217;s strategic effort to tap into Bermuda&#8217;s thriving crypto scene, supported by progressive regulations under the island’s Digital Asset Business Act.</p>



<p>During the summit, NEAR Foundation’s executive team and leaders from the institutional business segment were active participants, supporting various digital payment activations and Bermuda’s first-ever NFT art gallery. This engagement highlights NEAR&#8217;s commitment to exploring substantial business opportunities in Bermuda, particularly within its vast insurance sector, and strengthening its ties with local government and regulatory bodies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nayms-and-near-innovating-on-chain-insurance">Nayms and NEAR: Innovating on-chain insurance</h2>



<p>NEAR Foundation announced a partnership with Nayms that marks a pioneering step toward revolutionizing the insurance industry through blockchain technology. Nayms, a regulated marketplace for on-chain insurance, aligns with NEAR Foundation to develop innovative web3 products linked to insurance pools.</p>

As not only a leader in the regulation of digital assets but a massive global hub for insurance and reinsurance, Bermuda represents fertile ground for the collaboration.</p>



<p>The partners are setting out to transform traditional insurance models by enabling novel ways to underwrite risks associated with NEAR-based companies. The goal is to disrupt a multi-trillion-dollar market and offer institutional investors the chance to engage with new, attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunities in the field of on-chain insurance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mountain-protocol-and-near-foundation-expanding-digital-dollar-use">Mountain Protocol and NEAR Foundation: Expanding digital dollar use</h2>



<p>The partnership between NEAR Foundation and Mountain Protocol introduces the integration of Mountain’s USDM, a leading yield-bearing stablecoin, onto the NEAR protocol. This collaboration is set to transform how local businesses in Bermuda manage their treasuries by leveraging the stability and efficiency of digital dollars.</p>



<p>This strategic alliance enhances Bermuda&#8217;s capacity to utilize digital dollars, like USDM, within its extensive insurance and reinsurance programs. It taps into a $150 billion stablecoin market, reflecting Bermuda’s advanced digital asset regulation and its thriving financial ecosystem.</p>



<p>Additionally, NEAR Foundation will explore the potential of USDM in everyday applications, notably in partnership with HITCH, Bermuda&#8217;s leading transportation app. It’s about demonstrating how stablecoins can streamline transactions, reduce costs for drivers and riders, and showcase the practical benefits of blockchain technology in daily consumer interactions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expanding-digital-transactions-with-hitch-and-near">Expanding digital transactions with HITCH and NEAR</h2>



<p>As mentioned, NEAR Foundation also announced a partnership with HITCH to further embed digital assets into everyday transactions. The goal is to reimagine how local businesses and consumers handle transactions by adopting US digital dollars—USDC and USDM—within HITCH’s payment systems.</p>



<p>This initiative is expected to enhance cash management for businesses and streamline payment processes, offering greater efficiency and cost savings. By reducing transaction fees, HITCH can reinvest these gains into the local economy or offer enhanced rewards to drivers and riders.</p>



<p>Beyond improving ride-sharing transactions, the collaboration is set to broaden the use of digital dollars in Bermuda. HITCH plans to enable payments for government services like vehicle licensing and payroll taxes through its app, demonstrating the broad potential of digital currencies to simplify and secure routine financial activities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-extending-the-open-web-experience-with-mintbase-s-nft-gallery">Extending the open web experience with Mintbase’s NFT gallery</h2>



<p>Following the NEAR Foundation partnerships with Mountain Protocol and HITCH, the International Tech Summit also featured a significant venture into the world of digital art, powered by Mintbase. This event marked the debut of Bermuda&#8217;s first NFT art exhibition, curated by local art consultancy Mazar-Fox Art Consulting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aptly named “Redefining the Boundaries Between Art and Technology” and set in the iconic cruise passenger terminal at Hamilton&#8217;s Pier Six, the exhibition featured a mix of international and Bermudian artists, as well as educational workshops on NFTs conducted by Mintbase to deepen attendees’ knowledge and engagement.</p>



<p>These sessions included practical onboarding for attendees that enabled them to create and interact with digital art firsthand. Special edition NFTs were also offered as exclusive rewards for those who purchased limited edition merchandise, further integrating the digital art experience into the summit’s framework and enhancing the interactive nature of the gallery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last week, Korea BUIDL Week was the epicenter of cutting-edge thought leadership in Web3. From cross-chain innovations to the convergence of AI and blockchain, the week brought together industry pioneers to explore the technologies shaping the decentralized future.</p>



<p><strong>Chain Abstraction Day Tackles Interoperability</strong></p>



<p>Chain Abstraction Day kicked Korea BUIDL Week off by tackling the need for seamless blockchain interoperability. NEAR’s Co-founder and CEO, Illia Polosukhin, made a compelling case for &#8220;Why Web3 Needs Chain Abstraction&#8221; by highlighting how abstracting away individual chains can unlock Web3&#8217;s full potential. Mike Purvis of Proximity Labs then painted a vision of &#8220;Ushering in the Era of Bridgeless Cross-Chain DeFi,&#8221; while Riqi Ras presented &#8220;Bitcoin Beyond Gold&#8221;, showcasing snippets of a testnet transaction where a NEAR account signed transactions on Bitcoin. This proof-of-concept highlighted the potential of chain signatures to not just interact with Bitcoin, but even enable trading of Bitcoin Ordinals natively using the cross-chain signing capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Blockchain Brain Trust: Vitalik Envisions Account Abstraction, Illia Unleashes Chain Signatures</strong></p>



<p>At BUIDL Asia, anticipation was high for Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s talk on &#8220;The Future of Account Abstraction.&#8221; By abstracting user accounts, he explored enabling frictionless cross-chain experiences. “The next 10 years are going to be about really upgrading the ecosystem at the user level,” Buterin said at the event. Illia Polosukhin then took center stage, announcing NEAR&#8217;s groundbreaking &#8220;Chain Signatures&#8221; for managing assets across chains via a single account. Illia demonstrated how Chain Signatures allow signing transactions on multiple chains from a single NEAR account, paving the way for seamless cross-chain dApp development.</p>



<p>Illia and Vitalik later joined forces for a can&#8217;t-miss fireside chat dissecting the &#8220;AI/Crypto Fact vs Fiction.&#8221; As two towering minds in their respective fields, they offered unparalleled insights into AI&#8217;s transformative potential for Web3. The lively discussion separated hype from reality, exploring how AI could enhance privacy, scalability, and usability of decentralized systems. Vitalik and Illia also examined the risks of centralized AI models and the importance of developing decentralized AI aligned with Web3&#8217;s core values.</p>

<p>The event baton was then passed to ETH Seoul, where Mike Purvis expounded on &#8220;Chain Signatures: Cross-Chain Without Bridges.&#8221; Purvis explained how this technology enables secure cross-chain communication, eliminating the need for centralized bridges. He demonstrated how it could pave the way for seamless blockchain interoperability and conducted a workshop showcasing potential use cases.&nbsp; Boris Polania made a case for &#8220;Decentralized Intelligence&#8221;&nbsp; discussing how combining blockchain transparency with AI data analysis could revolutionize collective decision-making processes. The conference featured comprehensive developer tracks put together by DevHub, covering everything from building on NEAR to integrating Chain Signatures. ETH Seoul also hosted a hackathon where teams built innovative decentralized apps, with members of the NEAR ecosystem serving as judges to evaluate and provide feedback on the projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFiBrain, an AI-powered DeFi investment assistant that harnesses NEAR to discover and analyze promising DeFi products, won NEAR&#8217;s Chain Signatures bounty and ETH Seoul&#8217;s first prize. DeFiBrain impressed with its advanced AI models and seamless NEAR integration. The first prize of $5,000 for the NEARDevHub&#8217;s &#8220;AI Governance is NEAR&#8221; bounty was awarded to Connor AI, which integrates AI into DAOs to automate execution processes and empower decentralized decision-making. Connor AI was commended for its novel AI-DAO approach.</p>



<p><strong>Vitalik Outlines Ethereum&#8217;s Scaling Roadmap, Illia Tackles AI Misconceptions</strong></p>



<p>Not to be outdone, Vitalik outlined his vision for Ethereum&#8217;s future in &#8220;Dencun: Where We Go From Here.&#8221; During his talk, he primarily focused on EIP 4844, also known as “Blobs”, which represents a significant upgrade for Ethereum scaling. This upgrade allows Layer 2 networks to post batched transactions at a much lower cost. Consequently, Vitalik issued a call-to-action, encouraging developers to build solutions for today&#8217;s needs. Closing the event, Illia Polosukhin delivered a talk cheekily titled &#8220;Secrets About AI that Web3 Doesn&#8217;t Want You To Know,&#8221; likely pulling back the curtain on AI&#8217;s game-changing implications. Illia&#8217;s provocative talk challenged misconceptions about the limitations of current AI while hinting at potential breakthroughs that could supercharge decentralized applications.</p>



<p><strong>SheFi Emphasizes Cultivating Inclusive Web3 Communities</strong></p>



<p>Finally, SheFi spotlighted building inclusive Web3 communities. NEAR&#8217;s Yadira Blocker led the discussion on cultivating Web3 culture and community &#8211; a critical topic as the ecosystem grows. The panel emphasized genuine communities are earned through authentic connections, not purchased. It also discussed how global Web3 communities localize efforts while valuing in-person meetups to drive progress collaboratively. Unlike Web2, community heavily influences Web3 marketing and adoption.</p>



<p>From multi-chain architectures to AI convergence, Korea BUIDL Week demonstrated that Web3 is rapidly evolving towards a future of seamless cross-chain functionality, enhanced intelligence, and open participation. The insights shared will undoubtedly help shape the coming decades of decentralized innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://linearprotocol.org/">LiNEAR</a>, the leading DeFi protocol on <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR</a> with the highest TVL, is planning to enhance the security of NEAR&#8217;s Chain Abstracted network through restaking, ensuring a secure future for a chain-agnostic and chain-abstracted Web3 experience. Established by early core contributors to NEAR, LiNEAR has made significant contributions to advancing the ecosystem, beginning with its innovative liquid staking features, notably the Automatic Validator Optimization Algorithm. This algorithm greatly improves the security and decentralization of the NEAR network by dynamically reallocating stakes across as many as 200 active nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LiNEAR’s vision has always been enabling easier participation in the decentralized web. With the NEAR ecosystem&#8217;s commitment to advancing Chain Abstraction by removing the complexities of blockchain technology for users, LiNEAR is also expanding its offering and focusing on restaking to eliminate barriers to entry for the multichain ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LiNEAR Protocol will be providing a robust security model through <strong>omnichain liquid restaking</strong>, avoiding the pitfalls of centralized and permissioned solutions in pursuit of an improved Web3 user experience. Restaking can potentially secure Chain Abstraction infrastructures for three key reasons: it offers instant security by leveraging existing blockchain security mechanisms; ensures capital efficiency by allowing nodes and stakers of a blockchain to participate with minimal additional capital; and promotes base layer alignment, closely bonding the networks with the blockchains which they serve.</p>



<p>NEAR‘s Chain Abstraction comprises social authentication, <a href="/blog/unlocking-web3-usability-with-account-aggregation/">account aggregation</a>, Chain Signatures, and the multichain intent relayer. These elements combine to allow users to transact across various blockchains using a single account and interface, without the need to understand the underlying infrastructure or switch networks.</p>



<p>To realize this vision, two new decentralized infrastructures are required: the <a href="/blog/chain-signatures-launch-to-enable-transactions-on-any-blockchain-from-a-near-account/">Chain Signatures</a> MPC network and the Multichain Gas Relayer. The Chain Signatures MPC network functions as a decentralized signer of users’ NEAR accounts, controlling all other accounts on different blockchains. The Multichain Gas Relayer consists of off-chain relayers that listen to and compete to execute users&#8217; intents on different chains. Both infrastructures operate externally to any existing blockchain, including NEAR.</p>



<p>LiNEAR&#8217;s liquid restaking solution aims to secure the Chain Signatures MPC network, mitigating the risks of centralization. Similarly, the Multichain Gas Relayer would be able to operate in a trustless manner with restaked verification, removing embedded trust assumptions and enabling users to confidently delegate executions to the relayer network. This entire security framework can be supported by $NEAR and $LiNEAR, and other assets such as $SOL, $BTC, and more in the future, ensuring alignment with different blockchains connected through Chain Abstraction.</p>



<p>NEAR community members interested in restaking can get started on <a href="https://linearprotocol.org/">LiNEAR</a> and help move the network towards a more secure and easy-to-use Web3 world.</p>



<p><strong>About LiNEAR</strong></p>



<p>LiNEAR Protocol is an innovative omnichain liquidity staking/restaking platform and the leading DeFi protocol on NEAR. It pioneered revolutionary features such as automatic validator optimization, which significantly decentralizes and secures the network by allowing users to re-delegate to 200+ validators. LiNEAR offers seamless multichain restaking across multiple networks, such as NEAR, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and more, ensuring a secure future for a chain-agnostic and chain-abstracted Web3 experience.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At NVIDIA GTC 2024––the flagship conference of the AI hardware supercompany in San Jose, California––the spotlight was on the intersection of AI, blockchain, and the next era of open web innovation. Among the distinguished speakers was Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, who contributed his insights into how AI models will evolve and how blockchain and token economies can play key roles. Polosukhin is the only blockchain industry founder to speak at the NVIDIA event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “Transforming AI” panel was hosted by Jensen Huang, CEO and co-founder of NVIDIA. Appearing on the panel were all but one of&nbsp; the co-authors of the landmark 2017 research paper “Attention is All You Need,” which introduced the Transformer architecture that revolutionized natural language processing. That lineup of coauthors has gone on to work on projects such as OpenAI, Inceptive, and Essential AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group’s conversation explored the practical applications of blockchain technology, with Illia touching on programmable money and its impact on both the current and future states of digital economies. By addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the convergence of AI and blockchain, Illia offered a grounded perspective on the potential for these technologies to facilitate a more decentralized and efficient open web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Illia’s&nbsp; insights also highlighted NEAR&#8217;s commitment to leveraging Web3 technologies&nbsp; for broader adoption and innovation across a range of future tech use cases. Jensen himself noted that he thinks “NEAR is very cool.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-accelerated-computing-to-ai-and-the-blockchain">From Accelerated Computing to AI and the Blockchain</h2>



<p>Jensen kicked off the panel by providing context around the evolution of computing power and the potential of generative AI as the next industrial revolution. After a round of introductions, Illia dove into the beginnings of his research at Google and the unique challenges that brought AI to the forefront during that time.</p>



<p>&#8220;The team and I were working on simple question answering. You’d go to Google, you ask a question, and it should give you an answer,” Illia recounted. “But Google has very low latency requirements, so if you want to ship actual models that read search results, like tons of documents, you need something that can process that quickly. And models at the time just couldn’t do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>After publishing the paper and leaving Google to explore new opportunities, Illia first worked on NEAR as an AI startup, then pivoted when he and co-founder Alex Skidanov recognized an opportunity in the blockchain space they first encountered as users. They recognized a clear need in the space back in 2018: to make blockchain technology accessible and intuitive for everyday use. Illia discussed with the panel how that realization led him to the concept of programmable money, and subsequently built NEAR Protocol to address blockchain scalability and usability challenges, creating a shift towards a more user-friendly open web economy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-genesis-of-near-and-programmable-money">The Genesis of NEAR and Programmable Money&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Illia further discussed how his shift from pure AI research to Web3 was driven by the concept of programmable money, not just for cross-border payments but for a range of powerful use cases. This was a direct response to the challenges of coordinating on complex networks and the increasing demand for scalable blockchain solutions. The result is a platform that can handle large transaction volumes without compromising speed or security.</p>



<p>“NEAR has the most users in the world in the blockchain space,” Illia explained. “We’re talking about multiple millions of daily users who don’t even know they’re using blockchain. But they’re actually interfacing with programmable money and programmable value. And now we’re bringing back some of those AI tools to generate more data.”</p>



<p>He then highlighted the need for a shift in how creators are rewarded in an emerging age of generative AI, suggesting that the century-old copyright system must evolve. With artists and creators now leveraging tools like Midjourney and OpenAI for everything from visual art to storytelling, the panel agreed that copyright laws will need an overhaul sooner than later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-integrating-ai-for-fairer-user-and-creator-economies">Integrating AI for Fairer User and Creator Economies</h2>



<p>With the generative age already underway, Illia further unpacked how NEAR will be central to this new AI-enabled creator economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The way we’re rewarding creators right now is broken,” Illia continued. “And the only way to fix that is to leverage programmable money, programmable value, and blockchain. You need the basic primitive of programmable money because it’s what allows users and groups to coordinate people at scale.”</p>



<p>Illia&#8217;s vision extends to building a version of the open web where programmable value underpins a positive feedback loop, fostering a novel economy enriched by equitable participation. For example, he noted that NEAR is exploring ways for users to contribute their own data, which can help improve AI models. These initiatives demonstrate how tomorrow’s AI economy could benefit both creators and users by allowing more participation and collaboration underpinned by Web3 infrastructure and incentives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I strongly believe that the way we&#8217;re going to make progress towards software eating the world to machine learning is eating software,” Illia argued. “And the most direct way is to teach machines to code, so you&#8217;re able to actually generate software and transform everyone&#8217;s access.”</p>



<p>Throughout his appearance at NVIDIA GTC 2024, Illia underscored NEAR’s pivotal role in bridging the gap between the open web, programmable money, and AI. By advocating for a reimagined copyright framework and more equitable creator compensation models, Illia presented an accessible and compelling vision for NEAR at the forefront of tomorrow’s user and creator centric AI economy. While this was just a brief glimpse of the emerging AI+Web3 ecosystem on NEAR, it was met with a wave of excitement from the NEAR community and served as a reminder for the whole Web3 space about Illia’s and NEAR’s early roots in the world of AI.</p>

<p>Frax Finance announced the launch of FRAX stablecoin on NEAR via Ref Finance and Burrow through FraxFerry and the Rainbow Bridge. This marks a significant milestone for Frax as its first major venture into a non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frax Finance is the second-largest issuer of decentralized dollar-pegged stablecoins and an industry leader for DeFi infrastructure.</p>



<p>The NEAR ecosystem and Frax contributors will now collaborate through ongoing in-depth research and protocol integrations. One of the biggest opportunities between the two teams will be the introduction of short-term treasury yields on NEAR using sFRAX, a yield-bearing asset that tracks the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Interest on Reserve Balance (IORB).</p>



<p>In the coming months, Frax will natively issue their suite of assets, FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH, and sfrxETH on NEAR and Fraxtal, along with exploring opportunities around NEAR LSTs. Other protocols on NEAR will also be able to explore these exciting frontiers with Frax. While NEAR supports various stablecoins, the decentralized Frax platform sets itself apart by offering additional features like yield and LSTs. These offerings can be utilized by NEAR&#8217;s DeFi protocols for novel ventures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This deployment is led by Ref and Burrow and will soon expand to other protocols. <a href="https://www.ref.finance/">Ref Finance</a> is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on NEAR Protocol, designed to facilitate the swapping, lending, and borrowing of digital assets. It is a multi-purpose DeFi platform that integrates various financial mechanisms, offering users a comprehensive suite of DeFi tools. <a href="https://burrow.finance/">Burrow</a> is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on the NEAR blockchain, offering non-custodial, pool-based lending and borrowing services.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Highlighting the Incentive Campaign</strong></p>



<p>To boost activity and foster growth of Frax on NEAR, Ref will introduce an incentive program offering rewards for Liquidity Providers (LPs) in the USDC/FRAX and NEAR/FRAX pools, as well as the Curve style stableswap pools.</p>



<p>The proliferation of native stablecoins is crucial to the growth of DeFi as it facilitates effortless access to liquidity between protocols for users across various types of exchanges. This allows for more seamless interactions with different projects across the Web3 ecosystem, effectively removing bottlenecks and promoting a smooth trading experience. This also advances the NEAR ecosystem vision of Chain Abstraction, streamlining usability and defragmenting liquidity and UX across all of Web3. Moreover, native stablecoins will significantly enhance the visibility of the NEAR Ecosystem&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) within the market.</p>



<p>On Burrow, borrowers and lenders will earn incentives for using USDC, USDT, and FRAX. Additionally, Burrow will offer rewards for NEAR and liquid staked NEAR, with more details to be announced soon.</p>



<p>This incentive campaign will be expanded&nbsp; to other qualifying DeFi protocols and primitives after the initial rollout on Ref and Burrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re new to NEAR, you can find free resources for building apps, deploying smart contracts,creating blockchain operating system(BOS) components, and more on the <a href="https://docs.near.org/#">DevRel resources page.&nbsp;</a>Checkout the official documentation of <a href="https://docs.frax.finance/">Frax</a> to learn more about protocol and other technical specifications.&nbsp;</p>
